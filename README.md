This Jupyter notebook contains solutions to some common programming problems, organized as follows:

1. **Finding Multiples of 3 in a List**: Iterates through a list of integers, printing numbers divisible by 3.
2. **FizzBuzz**: A variation of FizzBuzz where numbers from 1 to 100 are categorized as "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "Hello World!" based on divisibility by 3, 5, or both.
3. **Palindrome Checker**: A function that checks if a word is a palindrome, ignoring case.
4. **Prime Number Finder**: A function to find and return all prime numbers up to a user-specified number.
5. **Caesar Cipher**: Implements basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption with a user-defined shift.
6. **Bank Account Simulation**: A class representing a bank account with deposit, withdrawal, and balance-checking methods, handling insufficient funds and non-positive amounts.
7. **Basic Calculator**: A calculator function for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.
8. **Number Guessing Game**: A guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.
